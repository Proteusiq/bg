Waiting for a Jupyter Lab cell to finish computing is ...! Let just send the task to the background.

# Disclaimer
Everything you see is done in 1 hour. Quality is not the case. The idea behind is.

# More coming soon

# Running services
```bash
# clone git and cd dir
docker-compose up --build -d
```

In Jupyter Lab, you can now push the tasks to the background
